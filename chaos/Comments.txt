This is a argument parsed python file for the NanoCircle script i've used to create the results which is going to be published in the sperm article.
This will just have 
-Simple 
-Chimeric
-Merge


However a newer version still under development is in the directory Argparse_test
which has the subcommands.
-classify
-simple
-chimeric
-merge
